Kubernetes Community Days is a community-organized, not-for-profit conference series for practitioners.

Sponsoring Kubernetes Community Days events gives your organization an opportunity to speak with practitioners, managers, and executives from companies of all sizes and industries. Whether your goals include recruiting new talent, opening new markets, or connecting with your existing customers, this event will be the place to have those conversations with experts and leaders in tech innovation.

Here's the Media Kit with a list of available sponsorships [PDF version](/img/2020-campinas/kcd_campinas_midia_kit.pdf).
