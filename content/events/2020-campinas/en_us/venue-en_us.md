## About the Location

**Associação IMA Cultural**

The IMA Cultural Theater is managed by the IMA Cultural Association, a non-profit organization, created in 2015 with the aim of promoting actions focused on culture and entertainment in the city of Campinas. Built in the 1960s, the Theater is located in an area attached to the IMA (Informatics of Associated Municipalities) building.

Since the creation of the IMA Cultural Association, the Theater has received a series of investments in modernization, which guarantee an air-conditioned space, with excellent acoustics and equipped with equipment that enable the success of the events held there. Although modernized, the Theater maintains the classic style, preserving the original wooden seats and the structure of the stage.
