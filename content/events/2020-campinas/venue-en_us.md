## About the Location

**Associação IMA Cultural**

The IMA Cultural Theater is managed by the IMA Cultural Association, a non-profit organization, created in 2015 with the aim of promoting actions focused on culture and entertainment in the city of Campinas. Built in the 1960s, the Theater is located in an area attached to the IMA (Informatics of Associated Municipalities) building.

Since the creation of the IMA Cultural Association, the Theater has received a series of investments in modernization, which guarantee an air-conditioned space, with excellent acoustics and equipped with equipment that enable the success of the events held there. Although modernized, the Theater maintains the classic style, preserving the original wooden seats and the structure of the stage.

## Local Transportation

More information can be obtained by using the [GVB](http://en.gvb.nl/) or [9292](http://9292.nl/en) websites. Both have excellent apps in the iOS ([GVB](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/gvb/id370393784) & [9292](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/9292/id556557690)) and Google Play ([GVB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.moopmobility.gvb&hl=en)) & [9292](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.negentwee&hl=en)) store.

A note to out of towners in in regards to obtaining a reloadable card for public transportation.
You can purchase an “OV chipkaart” at Amsterdam Centraal and most large metro stations (including Schiphol). Note that the unattended machines do not handle non-EU issued (e.g. Chip+Signature) cards well. Some U.S. Credit Unions now offer Chip+Pin technology on their debit card (note: not credit card). If your card doesn’t work or want to use Euros (other than coins), there is a customer service center located on the “IJ side” of Amsterdam Centraal where you can purchase a chipkaart in person at the [Service Office](https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/tickets-services/opening-hours-ticket-and-service-shops). If you’re arriving via Schiphol - a similar service is offered in the main train hall
