## What to expect?

Kubernetes Community Days Campinas is aimed at developers, operations people and all other IT professionals with an interest in cloud native technologies and are supported by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io).

KCD Campinas is a community-organized and not for profit conference and would not be possible without **our partners**. Don’t miss the opportunity to be part of and support this community conference. Find our [Partnership Proposal](sponsor) here.

We are expecting a big attendance while maintaining the grassroots spirit and the community feeling that is our underlying theme; we selected a great [venue](venue) and we extended the program to **full days of technical talks**, networking and bonding.

We will announce our [speaker](speakers)'s lineup in the ending of March; the call for papers is open until 13th of March (we will prefer talks in Portugues but we will provide simultaneous translation for sessions in english). If you wonder how to submit a great talk, have a look at this [page](cfp).

Our event would not be possible without support of our [sponsors](sponsor); prospective sponsors can review our [prospectus](sponsor) (here the [PDF version](/img/2020-campinas/kcd_campinas_midia_kit.pdf)) and get in touch with us via email. We're still finalizing our [program](program) but we're excited to have finalized a great [venue](venue). Please [contact](contact) the organizers with any questions.
